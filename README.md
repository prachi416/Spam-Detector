This data science project focuses on developing a robust Spam Detector using machine learning techniques to effectively filter unsolicited messages from legitimate ones (ham). The project involves comprehensive data preprocessing to clean and prepare text data for analysis. Using Python with libraries like NLTK for natural language processing, scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, and Streamlit for interactive web application development, the system selects suitable algorithms and optimizes them through hyperparameter tuning and model optimization. The goal is to create an accurate and efficient spam detection system that enhances email and message filtering capabilities, improving user security and experience.
